# HEROKU-DEPLOYMENT

### Description
##### Git is a powerful, distributed version control system that many developers use to manage and version source code. The Heroku platform uses Git as the primary means for deploying applications (there are other ways to transport your source code to Heroku, including via an API).

When you create an application on Heroku, it associates a new Git remote, typically named heroku, with the local Git repository for your application.

##### When you deploy to Heroku, the dependencies you specify in your requirements. txt file are automatically installed before app startup. If you're using Django, the collectstatic command also runs automatically during the deployment process. This command can be tricky to configure properly.
